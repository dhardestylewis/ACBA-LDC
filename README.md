# ACBA-LDC

Right-zoning
------------
_Amendment Tovo #4, from LDC Draft 2_
To protect renters, right zone city-wide existing missing middle housing, including triplexes and fourplexes.

_Reasons_
Amendment Tovo #4 aimed to correct historical downzoning which rendered existing buildings non-compliant. There exist many buildings throughout Austin which can no longer be used as they were intended due to downzoning. A comparison of Austinâ€™s land use inventory with the proposed zoning is a trivial way to discover these downzoned properties. So we did it.
